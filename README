DropboxConnect

THANKS
_______
This plugin is based on dropbox-php written by Evert under MIT License

INFO
____
This plugin intends to simplify connecting to a dropbox account 
even more. Meaning you can use it even without having either:
 	a. PHP's OAuth Extension
	b. PEAR's HTTP_OAUTH package

Unless stated otherwise it will first check if 
PHP's OAuth Extension or PEAR's HTTP_OAUTH package
are available (in that order) and will fall back 
to a PEAR package emulation. Thus , enabling you
the connection even if you don't have the above 
installed on your host.

HOW TO USE
__________
See the examples in the 'Examples' folder.
